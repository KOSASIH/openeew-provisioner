## Contributing

This provisioning app is built on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

In order to run it locally:
- [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your local machine

- Get dependencies
```
flutter pub get
```

- Ensure you have a device connected
```
flutter devices
```
_(NB this app will run in the web without a device, but due to the nature of the functionality, very little of it will work in the web environment.)_

- Compile and run
```
flutter run
```
